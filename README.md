**EL GRAN BOSTE** is a first person survival horror where you are pursued by a monster who can only be stopped by telling jokes. The objective in the game is to find the one joke who will kill it with laughter. This game was made over the course of 48 hours for the **Granada Global Game Jam 2024**, receiving minor fixes and improvements after the event. For more information, check out the design document in the repository or the game itself in our itch.io page.
